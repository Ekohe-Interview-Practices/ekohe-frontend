  ## COMMENTS ABOUT THE ASSIGNMENT

  - The app has a loading indicator at the top if you can't see it active network throttling on the browser.

  - Semantic HTML5 tags used for the content (main, footer, article, header, section, ...)

  - Media queries should work as expected, but I simplified it to common suggestions for iPhone and iPads. I can modify the demo easily to cover more devices with more precision. [Media Queries for Standard Devices](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/media-queries-for-standard-devices/). This demo only used the sizes on the sketch.
